          <h2><br>WELOME ADMIN</h2>
          <p > Now a day in India driver booking system is getting very popular and Most of the people
            want an ease of travelling using drivers. Instead of asking for auto rickshaw and taxis. Since
            there are lots of applications available for driver booking but they use centralized approach to
            Maintain data. "vehicle Share" Portal is a web-based technology that will
            manage the records of the driver and users. This application provides convenient and best
            service to customer (who wants to hire a driver) and driver (which wants to register) who
            easily register himself/herself. In "vehicle Share" Portal we use PHP and
            MySQL Database.</p>
